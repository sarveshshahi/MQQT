# MQTT – Message Queuing Telemetry Transport

## 📘 Overview

**MQTT** is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) environments. It allows devices to communicate by sending and receiving messages through a central broker.

---

## 🔧 Core Concepts

### 🔹 Broker
- The **broker** is the central server that receives all messages from clients and forwards them to the correct recipients.
- Popular brokers: **Mosquitto**, **HiveMQ**, **EMQX**.
- Without the broker, publishers and subscribers cannot communicate.

### 🔹 Publisher
- A **publisher** is a device or program that sends messages.
- It sends messages to a **topic** (like a channel).
- It does not care who receives the message.

### 🔹 Subscriber
- A **subscriber** listens to a topic and receives messages published on that topic.
- Multiple subscribers can listen to the same topic.

### 🔹 Topic
- A **topic** is a string that defines the channel of communication, e.g., `home/livingroom/temperature`.

## 🔄 How MQTT Works

1. The publisher connects to the broker and sends a message to a topic.
2. The broker receives the message and checks who is subscribed to that topic.
3. All subscribers of that topic receive the message.

## 🔌 Connecting and Disconnecting

### ✅ Connect to a Broker
To connect to an MQTT broker, you'll need:
- **Host/IP** (e.g., `broker.hivemq.com`)
- **Port** (default is `1883` for unencrypted, `8883` for encrypted/TLS)

#### Example using Python (`paho-mqtt`):
```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

client = mqtt.Client("client1")  # Unique client ID
client.connect("broker.hivemq.com", 1883)  # Connect to public broker
client.loop_start()  # Start loop to process callbacks
❌ Disconnect
python

Edit
client.disconnect()
client.loop_stop()
📨 Publishing and Subscribing
📤 Publish Message
python
Copy
Edit
client.publish("home/temperature", "22.5")  # Sends string "22.5" to the topic
📥 Subscribe to Topic
python
Copy
Edit
def on_message(client, userdata, message):
    print("Received:", str(message.payload.decode()))

client.subscribe("home/temperature")
client.on_message = on_message
💡 What is a String in MQTT?
In MQTT, messages are usually sent as strings. A string is a sequence of text characters.

Example:

"Hello World" – plain text

"22.5" – temperature as a string

"ON" / "OFF" – status commands

You can also send JSON or binary data, but strings are most common for simple applications.

🛠 Tools You Can Use
🧪 MQTT.fx – GUI client

🖥 Mosquitto – Open-source broker and CLI tools

🐍 paho-mqtt – Python library

🔧 Node-RED – Low-code IoT workflow tool

🧪 Example Flow
Device A publishes "22.5" to home/temperature.

Broker receives the message.

Device B, subscribed to home/temperature, receives "22.5".
